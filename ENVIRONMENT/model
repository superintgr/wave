[A] The general parallel computation requires:

[-1, -0] : mapping left-mid points
[-0, +0] : mapping mid-side points
[+0, +1] : mapping side-right points
[+1, -1] : mapping right-left points

[B] Two channels individually go through seperate buffers and processing stages to produce final output:

[-1][0] : [left][input][mid] -> [+][buffer][-]
[+1][0] : [right][input][sides] -> [+][buffer][-]

[C] For each compute step, a set of input nodes will produce a set of output nodes where the sum of node/antinode
ratios are kept conservative:

forward : (variable, constant : antinode, node)
backward : (output, difference : input, sum)

[D] Superposition of (node, opetator, antinode) and (variable, constant, memory) defines the possible set of computation variables:

Consider the static (left, right) variables where a dynamical operator will record states in a linear operations performed on those components using the (mid, sides) conjugate values per change applied to them.

The dynamic operator:

- mid : left and right -> 0.5 * left and right * 0.5
- sides : left or right -> 0.5 * left or 0.5 * right
