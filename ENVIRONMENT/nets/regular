parallel : any `p` is true while `q` -> not `p` and `q` <- `p` never is true

serial : `p + q` for any `p` from `P` and `q` from `Q` is true while `p * q` cannot be true but `q - p` may be true

composition : if parallel: all +1 can have all -1 while -1 ~ 0 or 0 ~ +1 and +1 -> 0 or 0 -> -1 is true for -1 and +1 must keep 0 in pair
