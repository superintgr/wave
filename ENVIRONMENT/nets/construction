A variable is a set of disjoint attributes. Given a task T, define its transpose as the task obtained from T by swapping each input attribute with the corresponding output attribute.

A constructor for a task T is a system which whenever presented with the substrate of T in any state belonging to one of the input attributes, it delivers it in one of the states of the allowed output attributes, and retains the ability to do that again, 4 .
  

  In electronics, a mixer, or frequency mixer, is an electrical circuit that creates new frequencies from two signals applied to it. In its most common application, two signals are applied to a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum and difference of the original frequencies. Other frequency components may also be produced in a practical frequency mixer.

Mixers are widely used to shift signals from one frequency range to another, a process known as heterodyning, for convenience in transmission or further signal processing. For example, a key component of a superheterodyne receiver is a mixer used to move received signals to a common intermediate frequency. Frequency mixers are also used to modulate a carrier signal in radio transmitters.
