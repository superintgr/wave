Buffer preparation is a common process in chemistry and biochemistry laboratories. A buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Buffer solutions are used to help maintain a stable pH value of another solution that is mixed with the buffer.

What is the purpose of a buffer system?
The main purpose of a buffer is to maintain the pH level to a certain value by neutralizing small amounts of acid or bases added to that particular solution. If an acid or base is added to a reaction, equilibrium gets disturbed. So, buffers are used to maintain the same pH value.

What is a buffer in a biological process?
The purpose of a buffer in a biological system is to maintain intracellular and extracellular pH within a very narrow range and resist changes in pH in the presence of internal and external influences.

What is a buffer system in simple terms?

A buffer system is a solution that resists change in pH when acids or bases are added to it. Buffer systems are made of either a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt. When an acid or a base is added to a buffer, the ratio of HX/X- does not change enough to affect pH significantly.

What happens in a buffer reaction?

If a strong acid is added to a buffer, the weak base will react with the H+ from the strong acid to form the weak acid HA: H+ + A- â†’ HA. The H+ gets absorbed by the A- instead of reacting with water to form H3O+ (H+), so the pH changes only slightly.

What is a buffer in the production process?
Buffering is a method used to ensure production doesn't reach a standstill and continues to run smoothly. A manufacturing-specific example includes keeping an inventory of raw materials on hand in case of any fluctuations in the production system. Perhaps a vendor didn't deliver some of your supplies on time.
