One can define a work medium as a substrate Q having a variable W = {w+, w0 } with the property that:

1.  
The task T+,0 = {w+ → w0 } belongs to an energy-equivalence class such that T+,0 is impossible and so is its transpose.
2.  
There exists an attribute w− of Q, disjoint from w0 and w+, such that the task:
Equation (2)
is possible.
Such a variable W is a work variable.
