If it is possible to extract deterministically different amounts wx of thermodynamic work, each from a single given physical system prepared in any one of a set of attributes x, then the attributes in that set are all distinguishable from one another, where 'attribute' hereinafter indicates a set of states.

A task is the specification of a transformation expressed as a set of ordered pairr of input/output attributes. Attributes are sets of states of a given physical system. A physical system on which tasks can be performed we call 'substrate'. 3 If a and b are attributes, the attribute (a, b) of the composite system S1 ⊕ S2 is defined as the set of all states of the composite system where S1 has attribute a and S2 has attribute b. I shall assume throughout the principle of locality (P1), which requires that if a transformation operates only on substrate S1 , then only the attribute a changes, not b. 

In quantum theory, for instance, a qubit is a substrate; one of its attributes is a set of states such that a given projector is sharp with value 1 in each state of that set. Denoting by 0 the attribute for the qubit's state to be in a given subspace and by 1 the attribute for the qubit's state to be in its orthogonal complement, an example of a task is {0 → 1, 1 → 0}, negating the qubit in a particular basis.
