[energy][transfer] : [transport][node][anti][node]
[transmission][kinetic][potential] : [standing waves do not carry energy], [nodes pass forces backend forth]
[remain][steady] : [node][pattern moves only by finite means][antinode]
[anti][node] : [cost is paid by the recurring oscillation pattern]

[plan][ahead] : [due to their conservative characteristic, I'd like to design a model of computation that uses standing wave basis]
[basis][attribute] : [variable that are in consideration must map to physical parameters]
[information][property] : [we would have defined a substrate with properties mapping physical attributes through sharp measurable/observable images]
