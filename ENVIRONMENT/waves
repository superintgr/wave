- is it possible to simulate electrical networks for their exchange in electromechanical waves,
- is it possible to simulate acoustical networks for their exchange in elastic energetic mechanical waves

room's have their intrinsic resonance profile
acoustic information effects the low-mid, mid-high frequency zones
- is it possible to model a network to represent one such room?

The input of acoustic energy to the room at the modal frequencies and multiples thereof causes standing waves. The nodes and antinodes of these standing waves result in the loudness of the particular resonant frequency being different at different locations of the room. These standing waves can be considered a temporary storage of acoustic energy as they take a finite time to build up and a finite time to dissipate once the sound energy source has been removed.
- if the model above is possible, is this task also possible?

- is VU meter possible?
- is dB measure possible?
- is metering possible?
- is headroom possible?
- is programme level possible?

in mac mini my terminal runs python interpreters
sometimes my safari lauches jupyter notebook server
jupyter lab uses ipython to run my code cells
so far i only mentioned my inputs and work
it is mac os or unix terminal that gives final response
any program is to be system process
- is it possible to replace all upstream tasks for any supporting the truth about downstream tasks?

in non pythonic or programming image it is not ovbious how new description would be
- is a new description excluding all bases while keeping high level descriptions be possible?
