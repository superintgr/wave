[Nondimensionalization] : is the partial or full removal of physical dimensions from an equation involving physical quantities by a suitable substitution of variables.
[substitution] : This technique can simplify and parameterize problems where measured units are involved.
[measure][unit] : It is closely related to dimensional analysis.

[dimensional][analysis] : In some physical systems, the term scaling is used interchangeably with nondimensionalization
[scale] : in order to suggest that certain quantities are better measured relative to some appropriate unit.
[relative][state] : These units refer to quantities intrinsic to the system, rather than units such as SI units.

[intrinsic][attribute] : Nondimensionalization is not the same as converting extensive quantities in an equation to intensive quantities
[extensive][intensive][thermal][dynamic] : since the latter procedure results in variables that still carry units.

[mix][state] : Nondimensionalization can also recover characteristic properties of a system.
[system][character][property] : if a system has an intrinsic `resonance frequency`, `length`, or `time constant`
[instric] : nondimensionalization can recover these values.

[recover][variable] : The technique is especially useful for systems that can be described by differential equations.
[control][analysis] : One important use is in the analysis of control systems.

[exponential][euler] : One of the simplest characteristic units is the `doubling time` of a system experiencing exponential growth
[decay] : or conversely the half-life of a system experiencing exponential decay;

[life][age] : a more natural pair of characteristic units is mean age/mean lifetime
[mean][half] : which correspond to base `e` rather than `base 2`.

[differential] : Many illustrative examples of nondimensionalization originate from simplifying differential equations. This is because a large body of physical problems can be formulated in terms of differential equations. 

[Consider the following] : 
. \List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics\List of partial differential equation topics\Differential equations of mathematical physics\.../.

[adaption] : Although nondimensionalization is well adapted for these problems, it is not restricted to them.

[normalization][differential] : An example of a non-differential-equation application is dimensional analysis; another example is normalization in statistics.

[measure][device] : Measuring devices are practical examples of nondimensionalization occurring in everyday life. 

[preperation][device] : Measuring devices are calibrated relative to some known unit.

[measure][relative] : Subsequent measurements are made relative to this standard.

[standard][scalar] : Then, the absolute value of the measurement is recovered by scaling with respect to the standard.
