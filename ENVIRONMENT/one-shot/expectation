[expectation] : function `psi` produces state `star`
[star] : ..
[


[value] : a perfect mapping of hidden states across distances
[linear][pair][n-ary][bit] : non linear successions of all coupled actions.

[expectation] : whenever one of the variables are being changes where the changes have to go across all relative associations
[capture] : any change made to one would required the other to contribute half of the identity to complete change in question.
[manage] : since all motions of one would require the other to have history, the goal would be to transport from environment to environment in jumps.

[task] : an ideal task is to be written soon.
[hint] : it has to do with mediums and transfers between them.
