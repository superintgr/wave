[expectation] : function `psi` produces state `star`
[star] : ..
[commute] : confirm what is being done and deny likewise

[expetiment] : we are sble to put a single atom in excited state
[tag] : by tagging the atom, we recognize it later.
[non][pertubation] : whenever we must learn its interactions within others
[task] : let us put another atom along the same time-like path
[knowledge] : let us also depend on the new atoms state but we cause it to put its state onto a known position
[information] : if ever we cross the agreed location of meeting, we will know imediately
[measure] : if we know any new information then let us our information bearing states to meet us back at some place again
[state] : once we meet at that place, we have been notified of our expectations.


[value] : a perfect mapping of hidden states across distances
[linear][pair][n-ary][bit] : non linear successions of all coupled actions.

[expectation] : whenever one of the variables are being changes where the changes have to go across all relative associations
[capture] : any change made to one would required the other to contribute half of the identity to complete change in question.
[manage] : since all motions of one would require the other to have history, the goal would be to transport from environment to environment in jumps.

[task] : an ideal task is to be written soon.
[hint] : it has to do with mediums and transfers between them.
