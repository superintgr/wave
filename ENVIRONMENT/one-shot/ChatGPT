[conjectured][recently] : [middleware], [bufferred interaction], [implicit expectation adjustment], [hidden branch management], [selecting top-k pathways]
[formulation][existing] : [whenever exploration of new and unsharp topics leading to long chain of explorable topics]
[long][chain[[exploration] : [.][create a concise cut of k types], [k cuts of thread points connecting existing left-right segements continuously]
[k][cut][continue] : [..][create a registered memory mapping event for each of the cut points and setup pairs of point coordinates at each junction connecting one of two possible continuation]
[junction][non][linear] : [...][labeled pathways one leading to existing conversation tree and the other is free to go on formulating seperate branch from any of the disjoint variables]
[disjoint][variable][trace][back] : [....][for branching independly from each possible alternatives, should there be folding or merging from external substrates to other disjoint pathways?]
