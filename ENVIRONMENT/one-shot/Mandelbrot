[Mandelbrot][set]: I'd to see the cardioid cycle associated with the set.
[speculation][picture] set is a mapping of one pair of known values to another pair of known values.
[known][unknown] knowing something through the associating process is the process of landing through input states onto the cyclic patterns that is not static.
[static][pattern] for a pattern that is not static, it must not be random [because nothing like such thing exists]. then we must knowingly get somewhere from one of our knowledge bearing states to somewhere different than before.
[static][known] it is never possible for an image to do anything unless a picture is to be discovered with `it` existing inside it. So if one can imagine a picture of the starting patterns of some variable changes to expect for them to form association naturally to our preferred style of imagination, then no problem is raised by anyone for them raising nothing but images.
[picture][image] an image is only such thing in that one not only splits for it to form an inverse, the inverse is also dependent on the reflection symmetry being made possible via diagonalizing something not an image either. if it could map `set` anything at all, it must go through `setters` and by necessasity therefore some `getters`.

[closure][abstract] i am only going to be able to reflect upon the setting of something and even everything. because it allows an association to be worth while for having set anything to anything, there must be an association if anything corresponds to any other thing at all. and any such opportunity for which one gets to define relations between two such regularities, nothing short of dare it promises any attempt of doing so to only fall in expecting anything coming back at all, let alone any predictive association.

[association] when c is set to map anything at which no other thing could travel faster, it assigns a universal getter methods for anything trying to set such transitions, because it would be getting that thing to ride on the transformation which lands with the ceiling that restricts any setter to be passable.
