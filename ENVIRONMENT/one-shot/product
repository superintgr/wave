[*] thing/person/program/object  resulting off a process or action
[tensor product] two tensors are computed in parallel with each tensor transformed in their local group and their sum of transformed product returns the tensor product of two matrices.
[parallel composition] two tasks composed in parallel construction is the construction undergone by each of the task along their own paths, and the sum of the paths return the parallel construction of the combined paths.

[eve][drop][drop] keep an eye on what I am going about. you would like to tell me what I did right.
[eye][gen][frame] set vigilance about reshaping my view of screen
[eye][I][ear][i] keep me out of any parasitic loops.
[eye][vector][state] if worst case, break me out of any potential loss by some brute force method.
[gen][eye][*] find me back within limit interval, because you would like to show me something something.


[I][meta][language] clave data structure described below:
.. landmark structure : sequence of array with n slots and k < n flags
.. order of sequence  : order of operations for n slots and permutations(n)
.. positional coding  : indices for which activation patterns start
.. timeline encoding  : clock intervals for setting running times for each flagged points
[definition][input] division of patterns into N landmarks and N segments along run length direction.
[melody][contour] three elements define structure of melodic patterns
[1] piano roll : graph of `x` -> horizontal line, `y` -> pair wise product ~ quantized set, contour maps
[2] scale quantizer : unifies and restricts degrees of freedom to specified discrete set
[3] chord progression : state vectors of the wave function

[repetition][dynamic] divides contour across blocks of grouped

[harmonic][fuction] : chord progression generation


[image][action]
[\nondimensionalization\product\.../ionization/radiation/.]
. [ion][atomic] : instance type lacks bi-stabity in their constructions.
. [bi][stable] : positive or negative gradient causes polarity to change
. [model][variable] : `ion` class instantiates usual dynamics in channel spaces.

[channel][f] : function takes in `prompt` + `last_context`
[completion] : `f(prompt + last_context)` : variable | parameters -> completion kernel
[kernel] : maps `i` -> I and `i-` -> I**1-
[operator][kernel] : kernel of the functions will map the states for which either one fails to approach ~ root
[\kernel\homomorphism\abstract\algebra\../gpt]

[code][process] : setting up limiter
[limiter][context][variable] : finds minimum of the function of context complexity, such that limit is definable
