how do you set input collecting frames?
a manim script renders the specified scene information onto the screen.
the objects are defined using geometric/functional/patterns etc. attributes specified inside the scene.
my task requires taking text input from one of the rendered images (state) into buffer.

how do you handle the programming of that script?

manim does not allow any such interface.
wx gui has basic graphical interface functions.
background and frame window must be custom but I have not tried them.
i used `pyinput` for setting some io routines and these should override keyboard and mouse interface on mac os.

can one prepare a gated block for all voltage coming from keyboard/mouse into ports before applying their realizations in os programs?
