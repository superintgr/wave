    A room structure in 3D space.

    Requirements:
    1. Must contain a viable architecture and hold legal permits,
    2. Any constructor(s) must retain their status across all development granted by their permits,
    3. Legal permit requires a proof of site with address inspected using structural code,
    4. All construction process upstream from the site location holds the foundational constructor accountable for tensorial analysis.

    Note: The stipulation [4] means that any levels that is made available at the weighted addressible block of code, will have downstream projections onto the floor per legitimate amplitude threshold event which realizes from the meter (ground) different subsystems that have their own local rooms.
    Note: Subsystems are branches of the foundational agreement which instantiates a unique construction process.
    Note: Any unique construction process must satisfy some transitional law which limits the possible accountability at that site.
