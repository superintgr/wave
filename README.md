# wave
Constructors whose object systems cause interference patterns.

**Standard interference workflow**

- An object instantiates code vectors whose object system consists of multidimensional subsystem parts,
- Any differentiable change brought upon into the objects static constitutions, would correspond to state vectors whose identity information does not point to single unique source,
- An unique source or target constitute a sharp observable set of quantities and the property is universal across all of the relative states within the subsystems code,
- Differentiable actions since conservative of invarient and symmetrical code or properties, will remain true although with branching complex introduced into the mix whenever interference is made impossible,
- Universal properties being true and their laws being universally effective, all effected branches that does not converge onto the same identity variables, either change irreversibly or sparsely remain connected to neighboring universes,
- If irreversible changes in identity does not meaningfully describe any of the descriptable attributes of the known universes, are considered unlike any of the source universes as they meaningfully violate the attributable criteria for information to be possible.


> The above do indeed outline the workflow or could be interpreted otherwise, as there are no operational description to specific interferring property for which the construction could be overseen.

## Structure of interferring waves:

- substrate specific property
- disjoint attribute
- physical variable
- logical variable
- abstract information
- implicit definition
- generic constructor
- regular network
- locally inaccessible information
- angular momentum
