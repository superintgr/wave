# wave
Constructors whose object systems cause interference patterns.

**Standard interference workflow**

- An object instantiates code vectors whose object system consists of multidimensional subsystem parts,
- Any differentiable change brought upon into the objects static constitutions, would correspond to state vectors whose identity information does not point to single unique source,
- An unique source or target constitute a sharp observable set of quantities and the property is universal across all of the relative states within the subsystems code,
- Differentiable actions since conservative of invarient and symmetrical code or properties, will remain true although with branching complex introduced into the mix whenever interference is made impossible,
- Universal properties being true and their laws being universally effective, all effected branches that does not converge onto the same identity variables, either change irreversibly or sparsely remain connected to neighboring universes,
- If irreversible changes in identity does not meaningfully describe any of the descriptable attributes of the known universes, are considered unlike any of the source universes as they meaningfully violate the attributable criteria for information to be possible.


> The above do indeed outline the workflow or could be interpreted otherwise, as there are no operational description to specific interferring property for which the construction could be overseen.

## Structure of interferring waves:

- substrate specific property
- disjoint attribute
- physical variable
- logical variable
- abstract information
- implicit definition
- generic constructor
- regular network
- locally inaccessible information
- angular momentum

## Substrate Specific Property

> ref: [strata, datum]

Consider a stack representing the geological stratum of an universe. The physics dictates that there be conservation of energy in each of the possible strata within the composition of tbe structure that encodes all the tensorial information.

The tensor that parameterizes that stack must be of one so that their model instances will always preserve the intrinsic symmetry in their parametrization scheme such that whenever an instance causes a differentiable change which results in now multiple other instances, and each of them are jointly isolated, their combined effect conserves the same net quantity with which the original instance had retained fixed point outputs.

For example the `GPT2` checkpoints constitute a closed system and as long as the layers are frozen thier transformations will always cause the same patterns in final state.

## Disjoint Attributes

If we prepare a new substrate with its base layer set to use the `GPT2` checkpoints, the frozen layers will represent the `disjoint attributes`, where the causal outputs from the base layer constitutes the **ground state** of the new substrate.

The physical variables are those quantitites whose substrates have the normalized outputs from `base layer` and their **logical state** attributes `x` in set `X` have all `x * x ~ x'` and `abs(x') == 1`.

That is for all differentiable chages caused by these frozen attributes will contribute a sharp state regardless of the measurable quantity.
