- host is a program which transforms a (4 x 4) matrix
- the matrix encodes all possible states of the input channels for which transformation is possible
- at each time step, all three channels record into a mixer with three mono tracks tracking each line(s) input
- since the speakers are interchanging variables, the mixer state at each time must provide a sample output
- at each step, each channel construct-section from master(s) last screened state
- at each step, for each state the master records into a substrate with two channels the state information
- finally, the room channel computes the acoustic information for creating a coherent image of each state of the mixer

<mixer program>

- prepare a device supporting all the channel requirements
- channels must provide at least 2 line output flows for each speaker channel
- channels must also support at least 1 line input from either mixer or current source
- mixer muat provide at least 2 main output ports for left and right mono current
- at each step, the mixer must record voltage levels for at least 2 external outlets and 1 internal inlet
- the external sources must get at least 1 sample per state evolution for each devices that provide current input to the mixer
- sampling requirement is fulfilled by any arrangements of the mixer channels not limited to the directly associated ones
- external outlets will write information in terms of dBFS measurement for their respective channel
