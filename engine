<coding descriptions>

- find the basis required for supporting all the upstream construction processes
- unit cell pairs with different substrates, joinly encoding physical and positional variables
- ties the dual conjugate pairs to two dimensional space, plane of interaction
- base state production from ground solved at the floor, scaled with respect to the balanced production
- cell/cell balance from forward retrodiction, only after last step replenishes the substrate
